Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear, then soak roughly two parts rice to three parts cold water in a saucepan for 30 minutes.

Next, bring the rice to the boil, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all the water and is tender. Check the packet instructions for exact timings.

Stir through the rice vinegar and sugar, itâ€™s easier to mix these before as the sugar will dissolve.

Cool the rice down as quickly as you can by spreading it onto a baking tray and covering with a slightly damp tea towel.


Place a nori sheet on top of your sushi rolling mat.

Dampen your hands to prevent sticking, then pick up a handful of rice and spread evenly on your nori sheet, leaving the top third uncovered.

Place a thin row of filling ingredients across the middle of the rice.


Hold the near edge of the mat, lift and roll away from you, encasing the filling. Ensure the ingredients stay in place and the rice sticks.

Dampen the top boarder with a little water to seal. Wrap tightly in cling film and chill until firm.

Brush your knife with rice vinegar to prevent sticking and cut the roll into neat rounds.

Serve with pickled ginger and a dollop of wasabi.
